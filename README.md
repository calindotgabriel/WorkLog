# WorkLog
What I'm trying to do with this app is a way to record one's time spent working on something.
It should at minimum:
Show you elapsed time / left time (inside app and with notification )
Let you take a break

Future:
Pomodoro technique break suggestions
CRUD sessions of work

This is a great way of learning things about services and broadcast receivers. For now the app doesn't really follow a design principle.
I'm just trying to dive deeper into the Android framework. Future development will surely consider better arhitecture.

Feel free to learn or ask me anything I've written here. Cheers
